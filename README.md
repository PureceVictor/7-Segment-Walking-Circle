Description
This project demonstrates a walking circle on the halves of a 7-segment driver, using an FPGA board to showcase dynamic motion on a segmented display. The movement is controlled by a state machine that sequences through the segments to simulate a "walking" circle. The project is implemented using SystemVerilog for hardware description and is synthesized with Quartus.

Hardware Used:
FPGA Board: DE10 Lite

Software Used:
Quartus Prime for FPGA synthesis and programming

SystemVerilog for hardware description

Features
Walking circle simulation on a 7-segment display

Control via a state machine to light up different halves of the 7-segment display

Implemented on DE10 Lite FPGA board for hardware testing
